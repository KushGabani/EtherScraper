Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991,
Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace.
Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.
Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms,
including structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented, and functional programming.
Python is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.

Selenium is a portable framework for testing web applications. Selenium provides a playback tool for authoring functional tests without
the need to learn a test scripting language (Selenium IDE). It also provides a test domain-specific language (Selenese) to write tests
in a number of popular programming languages, including C#, Groovy, Java, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby and Scala. The tests can then run against
most modern web browsers. Selenium runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS. It is open-source software released under the Apache License 2.0.
